the best option for you is Option 1: build and use a 
prebuilt Docker image that already contains PyTorch and other
 heavy, slow-to-download dependencies. It’s the fastest, most
  reproducible, and easiest to integrate into Jenkins without 
  changing the host system.

There are three requirements.txt files: each with their own dependencies
that are very expensive to set up every time there is a build.
Is there way so that everytime these requirements run, the 
dependencies are already there prebuilt?

Can we have a common prebuilt contains that will handle the 
expensive building process in the building of the jenkinsfile.
